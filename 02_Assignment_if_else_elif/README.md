# 📚 Grading System & Age Checker Program (Python Beginner Project)

## 📌 About This Project

This project includes **two small Python programs**:
1. **Grading System** ➔ It asks the user for their percentage and shows their grade (A1, A, B, C, D, F).
2. **Age Checker** ➔ It asks the user for their age and tells whether they are a child, teenager, adult, or senior citizen.

Both programs use **`if`, `elif`, and `else`** statements.  
This project is **perfect for beginners** who are learning decision-making in Python!

## 🖥️ Grading System Program

```python
percentage = int(input("Enter Your Percentage % :"))

# using nested if else
if percentage >= 0 and percentage <= 100:  # Check if percentage is valid
    if percentage >= 90:
        print("A1 Grade")
    elif percentage >= 80:
        print("A Grade")
    elif percentage >= 70:
        print("B Grade")
    elif percentage >= 60:
        print("C Grade")
    elif percentage >= 50:
        print("D Grade")
    else:
        print("F Grade (FAIL)")
else:
    print(f"{percentage}% is invalid percentage")
```

### 🔵 Program Explanation:

- First, the program **asks the user** to enter their percentage.
- Then it **checks** if the percentage is between **0 and 100**.
- If it is valid, it checks:
  - **90% or more** ➔ A1 Grade
  - **80% to 89%** ➔ A Grade
  - **70% to 79%** ➔ B Grade
  - **60% to 69%** ➔ C Grade
  - **50% to 59%** ➔ D Grade
  - **Below 50%** ➔ F Grade (FAIL)
- If the percentage is not between 0 and 100, it prints an **invalid percentage message**.

## 🖥️ Age Checker Program

```python
age = int(input("Enter Your Age :"))

if age >= 0 and age <= 100:
    if age <= 13:
        print("You are a Child.")
    elif age <= 20:
        print("You are a Teenager.")
    elif age <= 60:
        print("You are an Adult.")
    elif age <= 100:
        print("You are a Senior Citizen.")
else:
    print(f"Invalid Age {age} :(")
```

### 🔵 Program Explanation:

- First, the program **asks the user** to enter their age.
- Then it **checks** if the age is between **0 and 100**.
- If it is valid, it checks:
  - **0 to 13 years** ➔ Child
  - **14 to 20 years** ➔ Teenager
  - **21 to 60 years** ➔ Adult
  - **61 to 100 years** ➔ Senior Citizen
- If the age is not between 0 and 100, it shows an **invalid age message**.

## 🧠 If-Elif-Else Structure Flow Diagram

This simple flow diagram shows how the program moves step-by-step:

```
            [ Start Program ]
                   |
            [ Take Input ]
                   |
          [ Check if Input is Valid ]
                   |
        +----------------------+
        |                      |
  [ Valid Input ]         [ Invalid Input ]
        |                      |
        V                      V
  [ Use if-elif-else ]   [ Show Error Message ]
        |
        |-- If condition True --> [ Action 1 ]
        |
        |-- Elif condition True --> [ Action 2 ]
        |
        |-- Elif condition True --> [ Action 3 ]
        |
        |-- Else --> [ Default Action ]
        |
        V
  [ End Program ]
```

## 📢 Key Points for Beginners:

- **`if`** ➔ Runs a block of code if a condition is true.
- **`elif`** ➔ Runs when the first `if` is false but another condition is true.
- **`else`** ➔ Runs when none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are true.
- **Nested if-else** ➔ Means using `if` inside another `if`, useful for checking multiple conditions.

## 🚀 How to Run This Program?

1. Install Python on your computer.
2. Copy the code into a file (for example: `app.py`).
3. Open your terminal or Python IDE and run the file:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Enter your inputs and see the results!
