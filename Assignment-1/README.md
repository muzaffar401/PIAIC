# 🐍 Hello World - Python Greeter (Task 1)

This project is a beginner-friendly Python task demonstrating how to use object-oriented programming and testing in Python.

## ✅ Objective

Create a Python program that prints a personalized "Hello, World" message using a class and test it using `pytest`.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses a `Greeter` class built with Python's `@dataclass` decorator.
- Supports custom greeting names (e.g., "Hello, Muzaffar").
- Includes unit tests with `pytest` to verify functionality.


## 🧪 Testing

Test cases are written using `pytest`. They verify that:
- The default greeting is `"Hello, World"`.
- A custom name (like `"Muzaffar"`) returns `"Hello, Muzaffar"`.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Python `@dataclass`
- Writing clean class-based code
- Creating and running unit tests with `pytest`
- Basic Python packaging and module structure
