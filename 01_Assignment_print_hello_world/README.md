# 📚 First Python Assignment: Print Hello World

## 📌 About This Assignment

This is your **first Python assignment** where you simply **print "Hello World"** on the screen!  
You are also using a **variable** and an **f-string**, which is an amazing start! 🚀

---

## 🖥️ Code

```python
# First Assignment: Print Hello World

a: str = "Hello World"
print(f"My first task is to print {a}")
```

---

## 🔵 Explanation

Let's understand what each line does:

- `a: str = "Hello World"`  
  ➔ Here, we **created a variable `a`** and stored the text `"Hello World"` in it.  
  The `: str` tells Python that `a` is a **string** type (this is called **type hinting**).

- `print(f"My first task is to print {a}")`  
  ➔ This line **prints the message** on the screen.  
  We used an **f-string** (`f""`) to **insert** the value of variable `a` inside the print statement.

✅ Output:

```
My first task is to print Hello World
```

## 🧠 Quick Concept Map

```
[ Variable a ] --> stores --> [ "Hello World" ]
       |
       v
[ print() function ] --> prints --> [ My first task is to print Hello World ]
```
