# Python Built-in Functions and Concepts

This repository covers essential Python built-in functions and programming concepts with clear examples in Urdu/Hindi. The content is designed to help beginners understand fundamental Python operations.

## Main Topics Covered:

### 1. Built-in Functions
- `id()` - Shows memory location of variables
- `type()` - Returns variable type
- `dir()` - Lists available methods for a data type
- `len()` - Returns length of strings/lists
- String checking functions (`isdigit()`, `isalpha()`, `isalnum()`, etc.)
- Number validation functions (`isdecimal()`, `isnumeric()`)

### 2. Functions
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Default parameters
- Conditional logic in functions

### 3. List Operations
- List indexing
- Essential list methods (`append()`, `clear()`, `copy()`, `count()`, etc.)
- List slicing techniques (basic, negative indexing, stepping, reversing)

## Code Examples
Each concept is demonstrated with practical Python code examples showing inputs and expected outputs.

This material serves as a quick reference for Python beginners to understand core language features and common operations.
